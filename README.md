# 🌸 mood:e 🌸  

**mood:e** is a personal project to practice my coding, AI, and security skills while improving my documentation and project structure. It’s a creative app that connects emotions to Spotify playlists and tasks—something fun, useful, and totally me.

## 🌈 Why I’m Building This  

There are so many personal projects out there, but most of them feel like things I wouldn’t use. So, I decided to make something I *would* use; something pretty, creative, and practical.  

With **mood:e**, I’m also challenging myself to:  
- Practice writing clean, structured documentation. ✍️  
- Build coding, security, and AI skills hands-on. 💻  
- Take an idea from concept to completion. 🚀
